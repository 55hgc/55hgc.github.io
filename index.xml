      <description>Twitter
The Process First, I opened ChatGPT and instructed it with the prompt Write &amp;quot;Twitter&amp;quot;.
Next, I double clicked ChatGPT&amp;rsquo;s output to select it, and right clicked to copy it to my clipboard.
Next, I opened Neovim and used the command :&amp;quot;+y to paste from my clipboard.
Next, I used the command :w to finally write Twitter.
A Speech of Gratitude Ladies and gentlemen, esteemed guests, and dear friends,
I stand before you today not as myself, but as hgc, the writer of Twitter.</description>
